# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Analysis
The objective of this project is to build a data processing and machine learning pipeline that  takes raw Titanic passenger data, cleans it, perform EDA, extracts  useful features, trains a predictive model, and evaluates its performance. The pipeline will be  modular, ensuring efficient data handling and reusability.
